"""Collect per-run best scores from a SYMFLUENCE_data tree into a platform CSV.

Each reproduction machine runs this against its own data root and commits only
its own metrics_<platform>.csv, so concurrent updates from several machines
never conflict.

Usage:
    python collect_metrics.py --platform macos --root /path/to/SYMFLUENCE_data
    python collect_metrics.py --platform wsl --root ~/repos/SYMFLUENCE_data
    python collect_metrics.py --platform native_windows --root C:/Users/me/repos/SYMFLUENCE_data

Output: metrics_<platform>.csv next to this script with columns
    experiment_id,domain,metric,best_score,eval_score,best_iteration,collected_at
Rows are keyed by experiment_id; re-running refreshes values in place.

best_score is the CALIBRATION objective — the endpoint of a stochastic search
(e.g. 1000 DDS iterations). Across architectures (ARM64 vs x86_64) the models
produce floating-point-different objective values, so the optimiser takes a
different accept/reject path and lands on a different-but-comparable optimum;
on models with a rough response surface that makes best_score diverge well
beyond the 0.02 tolerance even when nothing is wrong. eval_score is the
out-of-sample metric at the found optimum, which is what actually answers
"did the two machines reproduce each other" — two different calibration paths
that both generalise to ~0.87 ARE a reproduction.
