# Paper Experiment Configurations

Index of the experiment configs behind *"From Configuration to Prediction"*.
For installation, credentials, data location, and the suggested run order, see
[`../README.md`](../README.md). Each experiment directory has its own README
with per-config details and expected results.

Every experiment is run the same way:

```bash
symfluence workflow run --config <config.yaml>
```

## Experiments

## Config anatomy

Every config is **standalone** — there is no base-config inheritance and no
override mechanism. What you see in one file is the complete experiment.

- **`system.workflow_steps`** — each config lists exactly the pipeline steps it
  needs, in order. `symfluence workflow run` executes only those steps:
  domain-definition configs stop after `discretize_domain`; the benchmarking
  config runs no model steps at all. Completed steps are tracked with stage
  markers, so configs that share a domain (e.g. all of experiment 02) reuse
  downloaded and preprocessed data automatically.
- **`system.data_dir: default` / `code_dir: default`** — inputs and results go
  to a `SYMFLUENCE_data/` directory created as a sibling of the cloned repo,
  overridable with the `SYMFLUENCE_DATA_DIR` environment variable. Configs are
  independent of the current working directory.
- **`system.random_seed`** — calibration configs pin the seed used for the
  paper (e.g. `random_seed: 42`), so optimization trajectories are
  deterministic on a given platform.

Results for a config land under `SYMFLUENCE_data/domain_<name>/` (see
`../README.md` §3 for the layout).
