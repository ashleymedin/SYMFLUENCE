# Rebuild netCDF-C for mingw-w64 WITHOUT the AWS S3 SDK and install it over the
# MSYS2 prefix.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this exists
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MSYS2's stock `mingw-w64-x86_64-netcdf` is built with -DNETCDF_ENABLE_S3_AWS=ON
# (`libnetcdf.settings` reports "S3 Support: yes / S3 SDK: aws-sdk-cpp"). netCDF
# then registers a shutdown hook that calls Aws::ShutdownAPI at
# DLL_PROCESS_DETACH. By that point RtlExitUserProcess has already terminated the
# AWS CRT worker threads, so ShutdownAPI blocks forever in
# SleepConditionVariableSRW waiting on threads that can never respond:
#
#   main -> stop_program -> libgfortran -> msvcrt!_exit
#     -> RtlExitUserProcess -> LdrShutdownProcess          (DLL_PROCESS_DETACH)
#     -> libnetcdf.dll -> libaws-cpp-sdk-core (Aws::ShutdownAPI)
#     -> libaws-crt-cpp -> libaws-c-common
#     -> SleepConditionVariableSRW                          <- blocks forever
#
# The process gets a valid exit code but its last thread never finishes, so the
# process object never signals: GetExitCodeProcess returns the code while
# WaitForSingleObject times out forever. Every model run (SUMMA, FUSE, HYPE, ...)
# leaves an unkillable zombie holding its output NetCDF file handles, which
# poisons subsequent calibration evaluations. Only a reboot clears them.
#
# Fix: build netCDF-C with S3 off. BYTERANGE stays ON (curl-only, no AWS), so
# remote-read over plain HTTP still works; only the aws-sdk-cpp code path goes.
# The resulting DLL is a drop-in: its export table is the stock table minus the
# NC_s3sdk*/NCZ_s3finalize symbols, none of which libnetcdff-7.dll imports, so
# no model binary needs relinking. Verified below before the script exits.
#
# Everything else mirrors the MSYS2 netCDF PKGBUILD's shared build so the result
# stays feature-identical to the package it replaces (DAP2/DAP4, NCZarr, HDF5,
# plugins, standard filters).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   scripts/build_netcdf_no_s3_mingw.sh [work_dir]
#
# Environment:
#   MINGW_PREFIX     mingw64 prefix to build against and install into
#                    (default: C:/msys64/mingw64)
#   NETCDF_VERSION   override the netCDF-C version to build. By default the
#                    version is read from the installed MSYS2 package so the
#                    replacement always matches the ABI the rest of the prefix
#                    (netcdf-fortran, nc-config, headers) was built against.
#   NETCDF_JOBS      ninja parallelism (default: nproc)
#   NETCDF_INSTALL_PREFIX
#                    where to install the result (default: MINGW_PREFIX, i.e.
#                    replace the stock package in place). Point this elsewhere
#                    to rehearse the whole build + verification without
#                    modifying a working MSYS2 installation.
