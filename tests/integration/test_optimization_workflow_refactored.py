"""
Integration test for optimization workflow after Phase 1 refactoring.

Tests that the optimization infrastructure still works correctly after:
1. Moving routing_decider to models/utilities/
2. Moving fuse_conversion to models/fuse/utilities/
3. Breaking circular dependencies between models and optimization

This test ensures OptimizerRegistry can still discover and instantiate
model-specific optimizers, workers, and parameter managers.
