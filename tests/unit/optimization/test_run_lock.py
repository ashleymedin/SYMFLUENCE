"""Tests for the calibration run-directory lock (issue #329).

Two runs of the same model+experiment share per-process settings and
simulation dirs, so the second re-stages over the live one and its cleanup()
deletes them. Different models in one domain are scoped apart and must stay
free to run concurrently. These tests pin both halves of that behaviour.
