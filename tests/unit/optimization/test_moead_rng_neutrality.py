"""MOEA/D must not spend the seeded RNG on capability probing.

A probe that draws from the global RNG before the search starts shifts every
subsequent draw, so a seeded run stops matching runs made before the probe
existed — the search is deterministic but explores a different trajectory.
These tests pin the two properties that matter: the all-penalty fallback is
decided from the initial population (no extra draw, no extra model run), and
it is decided from the whole population rather than a single candidate.
