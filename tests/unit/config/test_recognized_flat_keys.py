"""RECOGNIZED_FLAT_KEYS is a closed set.

The flat-key audit (docs/adr/config_flat_key_audit.md) promoted every
formerly-recognized key into a typed Pydantic field, an alias, or deleted
it as dead. The set now holds only deprecated keys consumed by
compatibility validators. These tests keep it that way: new config keys
must get Pydantic fields (or plugin-declared schemas, ADR-0002) so they
are typed, documented in the comprehensive template, and typo-checked —
adding to RECOGNIZED_FLAT_KEYS instead would bypass all three.
