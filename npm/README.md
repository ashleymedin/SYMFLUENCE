# SYMFLUENCE - npm Package

Pre-compiled hydrological modeling tools for SYMFLUENCE framework.

## What's Included

This package downloads the pre-built tool bundle for your platform. The release
pipeline builds and stages:

- **SUMMA** - Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives
- **mizuRoute** - Multi-scale routing model
- **FUSE** - Framework for Understanding Structural Errors
- **NGEN** - NOAA Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework
- **TauDEM** - Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models
- **HYPE**, **MESH**, **CRHM**, **mHM**, **PRMS**, **SWAT**, **GSFLOW**,
  **RHESSys** - the remaining paper-reproduction models
- **VIC**, **WRF-Hydro**, **WATFLOOD**, **MODFLOW 6**, **ParFlow**,
  **CLM-ParFlow**, **PIHM**, **CLM**, **NoahMP**, **WMFire**

Not every model builds on every platform. The bundle's `toolchain.json` and the
staging summary in the release logs record exactly what shipped; `symfluence
binary info` reports what is present locally.

> **RHESSys note:** the bundled RHESSys is the upstream build. The paper's
> subsurface-groundwater patch is applied only by
> `symfluence binary install rhessys --patched` (or `--paper-repro`), so
> reproducing the paper's RHESSys results still requires a source build.

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g symfluence
```

This will:
1. Download platform-specific pre-compiled binaries (~50-100 MB)
2. Extract them to your global npm directory
3. Make the `symfluence` command available
4. Install the SYMFLUENCE Python package automatically, pinned to the same
   version as the npm package (via `uv`, `pip3`, or `pip` — whichever is found)
5. Verify the installed Python CLI version matches the npm package

No separate `pip install symfluence` is needed. For the PyTorch-based
features (LSTM/GNN models, differentiable coupling), add the ML extra
afterwards: `pip install "symfluence[ml]"`.

Opt-out environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `SYMFLUENCE_SKIP_SYSTEM_DEPS=1` | Skip the NetCDF/HDF5/GDAL system-library check entirely |
| `SYMFLUENCE_AUTO_SYSDEPS=1` | Allow the installer to run `sudo apt-get`/`dnf` for missing libraries (default: it prints the command instead; brew/conda/root installs never need this) |
| `SYMFLUENCE_OPTIONAL_PYTHON=1` | Install the binary bundle only (built-in commands only) |

### Local Installation

```bash
npm install symfluence
```

## Supported Platforms

- **Linux**: x86_64 (Ubuntu 22.04+, RHEL 9+, Debian 12+)
- **macOS**: ARM64 (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3, macOS 12+)
- **Windows**: x86_64 (Windows 10+; runtime libraries bundled in the tarball)

Other combinations (Intel macOS, Linux ARM64) have no pre-built bundle — the
installer fails fast with a clear message; build from source instead
(`symfluence binary install`).

## System Requirements

### Linux

- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04+, RHEL 9+, or Debian 12+
- **glibc**: ≥ 2.35
- **Libraries** (must be installed):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libnetcdf19 libnetcdff7 libhdf5-103 libgdal32
  ```

### macOS

- **OS**: macOS 12 (Monterey) or later
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon (ARM64)
- **Libraries** (install via Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install netcdf netcdf-fortran hdf5 gdal
  ```

For detailed requirements, see [SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.md](https://github.com/symfluence-org/SYMFLUENCE/blob/main/docs/SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Usage

### Check Installation

```bash
symfluence info
```

This shows:
- Installed version
- Platform information
- Available tools
- Build metadata
- Binary directory path

### Use Tools Directly

#### Option 1: Add to PATH

```bash
# Bash/Zsh
export PATH="$(npm root -g)/symfluence/dist/bin:$PATH"

# Fish
set -x PATH (npm root -g)/symfluence/dist/bin $PATH
```

Then run tools directly:
```bash
summa --version
mizuroute --help
ngen --version
```

#### Option 2: Use Full Path

```bash
$(npm root -g)/symfluence/dist/bin/summa --version
```

#### Option 3: Use with SYMFLUENCE Python Package

The Python package is installed automatically by `npm install` (see above),
and the `symfluence` command forwards all non-built-in commands to it with
the npm-shipped binaries already on PATH. Manual setup is only needed if you
opted out with `SYMFLUENCE_OPTIONAL_PYTHON=1`:

```bash
# Install Python package manually (match the npm package version)
pip install "symfluence==$(symfluence version)"

# Configure to use npm-installed binaries
export SYMFLUENCE_DATA="$(npm root -g)/symfluence/dist"
```

### Get Binary Directory

```bash
symfluence path
```

## Commands

```bash
symfluence info       # Show installation info, available tools, Python CLI version
symfluence version    # Show version
symfluence path       # Show binary directory path
symfluence help       # Show help
```

All other commands (`workflow`, `binary`, ...) are forwarded to the Python
CLI. If the Python package version ever drifts from the npm package (e.g. an
old pip install survived an npm upgrade), every forwarded command prints a
warning with the exact command to re-sync.

## Upgrading

```bash
npm update -g symfluence
```

This re-runs the installer: binaries are replaced with the new release and
the Python package is upgraded in place to the matching pinned version.

## Uninstalling

```bash
npm uninstall -g symfluence
```

This removes the binaries and the tool shims. The Python package installed
with system pip/uv is not removed — remove it separately; the uninstaller
prints a reminder when it detects one:

```bash
pip uninstall symfluence
```

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Fails

1. **Check platform support**:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(process.platform, process.arch)"
   ```
   Must be `linux x64`, `darwin arm64`, or `win32 x64`

2. **Check internet connection**: Downloads from GitHub Releases

3. **Verify release exists**:
   https://github.com/symfluence-org/SYMFLUENCE/releases

4. **Try manual installation**: See repository README

### "libnetcdf.so.19: not found" (Linux)

Install required libraries:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libnetcdf19 libnetcdff7 libhdf5-103
```

### "dyld: Library not loaded" (macOS)

Install required libraries:
```bash
brew install netcdf netcdf-fortran hdf5
```

### "version `GLIBC_2.35' not found" (Linux)

Your system has an older glibc. Options:
- Upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04+ / RHEL 9+ / Debian 12+
- Build from source (see repository docs)
- Use Docker (see repository docs)

## Development

### Local Testing

```bash
# In the npm/ directory
npm install .          # Test installation
node install.js        # Test download manually
./bin/symfluence info  # Test CLI
```

### Publishing

```bash
# Update version in package.json to match release tag
npm publish
```
