"""
Embedded-R runtime setup for the GR models.

Three problems are solved here, all of which only bite when R runs *embedded*
inside the SYMFLUENCE process (via rpy2) rather than as a standalone
``Rscript`` process.

**1. Windows DLL search path.**

R package shared objects such as ``stats.dll`` link against ``Rblas.dll`` and
``Rlapack.dll``, which live in ``R_HOME/bin/x64`` and nowhere else. In a
standalone ``Rscript`` process those two DLLs are already loaded (the
interpreter binary sits in the same directory), so the imports resolve by
module name. Embedded, only ``R.dll`` gets loaded up front — ``R.dll`` imports
``Rblas.dll`` but *not* ``Rlapack.dll`` — and R's own ``dyn.load()`` then calls
``LoadLibrary`` through the legacy search order, which searches ``PATH`` but
*not* directories registered with ``os.add_dll_directory()``.

rpy2 only registers ``R_HOME/bin/x64`` via ``os.add_dll_directory()``. That is
enough to load ``R.dll`` itself but not enough for ``dyn.load()``, so unless
``R_HOME/bin/x64`` is also on ``PATH`` every compiled R package fails to load
with::

    unable to load shared object '.../library/stats/libs/x64/stats.dll':
      LoadLibrary failure:  The specified module could not be found.

which R reports at startup as the misleading::

    package 'stats' in options("defaultPackages") was not found

:func:`configure_r_dll_search` puts R's binary directory on ``PATH`` before
rpy2 is imported, which fixes every compiled R package at once.

**2. Fail fast on a missing/unloadable airGR.**

The GR runner used to react to a failed ``library(airGR)`` by calling
``install.packages()`` against CRAN mid-run. On a machine with no outbound
network that leaves the embedded interpreter wedged — observed as a SIGSEGV
after the workflow had already spent 53 minutes preprocessing. Callers should
instead invoke :func:`ensure_airgr_available` before doing any real work so a
broken R shows up as an actionable error in seconds.

**3. Windows paths inside generated R source.**

The GR runner builds R scripts by interpolating filesystem paths into R string
literals. On Windows ``str(Path)`` yields backslashes, so
``C:\\Users\\me\\data.csv`` reaches R's lexer as the literal
``"C:\\Users\\me\\data.csv"``, in which ``\\U`` starts a Unicode escape and
``\\d`` is not an escape at all.

Standalone ``Rscript`` reports that as a clean parse error. Embedded, R raises
it from inside its string lexer while ``R_ParseVector`` is running, which on
Windows takes down the whole process with ``STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION``
(0xC0000005 — Git Bash reports it as exit 139) instead of surfacing an
``RParsingError``. faulthandler cannot even print the faulting frame. Verified
on rpy2 3.6.7 with R 4.6.1: a *runtime* R error and an *incomplete* parse both
raise normally, while an invalid escape in a string literal always aborts.

:func:`r_path` renders a path as an R literal with forward slashes (which R
accepts on every platform), and :func:`run_r_script` refuses to hand R any
source containing an invalid escape, so a future regression is an actionable
error rather than a bare access violation.
