"""
FUSE model module.

This module provides a clean, modular structure for the FUSE (Framework for
Understanding Structural Errors) hydrological model integration.

The module has been refactored from a single large file (fuse_utils.py, 3094 lines)
into separate components for better maintainability and organization.

Main Components:
    - FUSEPreProcessor: Handles FUSE preprocessing and setup (preprocessor.py, ~350 lines)
    - FUSERunner: Executes FUSE model simulations (runner.py, 1194 lines)
    - FUSEPostprocessor: Processes FUSE model outputs (postprocessor.py, 95 lines)
    - FuseStructureAnalyzer: Analyzes FUSE model structure ensembles (structure_analyzer.py)

Manager Classes (Refactored 2026-01-01):
    - FuseForcingProcessor: Handles forcing data transformations (forcing_processor.py, ~350 lines)
    - FuseElevationBandManager: Manages elevation band creation (elevation_band_manager.py, ~290 lines)
    - FuseSyntheticDataGenerator: Generates synthetic hydrographs (synthetic_data_generator.py, ~170 lines)

Refactoring History:
    - 2025-12-31: Initial refactoring from fuse_utils.py
    - 2026-01-01: Manager extraction and modularization (reduced preprocessor from 1441 → 350 lines)

For backward compatibility, all public classes are re-exported at the package level.
