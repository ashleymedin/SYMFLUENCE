"""Subprocess execution that survives Windows exits which never signal.

On Windows a process object is signaled only once its *last thread* exits.
Native model binaries here regularly terminate — handing back a real exit code
— while leaving one thread parked in a kernel wait, so the object never
signals. Measured on a wedged SUMMA worker::

    GetExitCodeProcess(38420)        -> 1     # the Fortran STOP 1
    WaitForSingleObject(38420, 5000) -> 258   # WAIT_TIMEOUT, never signals

Seven stuck processes were checked (SUMMA and FUSE, four domains): every one
had a valid exit code and none was signaled. ``Popen.wait()`` blocks on
exactly that signal, and ``Popen.poll()`` is no escape — CPython's Windows
implementation gates it on ``WaitForSingleObject(handle, 0)`` too. So the
result is already known to the OS and unreachable through the stdlib.

The cost was not subtle: a SUMMA evaluation that failed instantly with
``STOP 1`` still billed its full 7200s timeout, and a paper-reproduction group
spent 21h without finishing one NSGA-II generation.

``wait`` and ``run`` below prefer the process's exit code over its signal, so
a finished process is reported finished. The stuck thread is left behind; it
consumes no CPU and cannot be killed, and a leaked zombie is a far better
outcome than blocking the workflow for hours.
