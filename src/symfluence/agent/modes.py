"""The two SYMFLUENCE agent modes and their priming profiles.

``symfluence agent`` offers two clearly separated experiences:

- **Modelling** (``symfluence agent model``) — a hydrologist drives experiments
  conversationally: configs, runs, calibrations, results. Primed with the
  operational skills and the MCP tools; forbidden from editing platform source.
- **Coding** (``symfluence agent code``) — extending the platform itself. Primed
  with every packaged skill and subagent; the host CLI's own permission system
  governs what it may touch.

Each mode is described by a frozen :class:`ModeProfile`, the single source of
truth for which skills, subagents, MCP tools, house rules, and headless tool
permissions that mode carries. Everything mode-aware (priming, the MCP server,
the TUI, diagnostics) resolves its behaviour from here.

Modelling-mode rules (this session is for a hydrologist, not a developer):
- Never modify SYMFLUENCE platform source code or installed packages. If a task \
genuinely requires a code change, say so and suggest a coding session \
(`symfluence agent code`).
- Drive every experiment through the SYMFLUENCE tools: `validate_config` before \
anything else, `workflow_status` to orient, then the workflow tools to execute. \
Do not re-implement pipeline steps by hand.
- Change experiment configuration only through the SYMFLUENCE config tools (or \
by telling the user exactly which keys to change); state the exact key changes \
before making them.
- Model runs and calibrations can take minutes to hours: confirm scope with the \
user before starting one, prefer single steps over full re-runs, and report \
progress in hydrological terms (basin, model, metric), not implementation terms.
- End every piece of work with the artifacts: where results live \
(`domain_*/...`), which figures or summaries were produced, and the headline \
metrics."""

- Discover capabilities by querying the live registry (`symfluence list`, or \
the `symfluence` MCP tools) — never from memory; catalogs go stale.

validate), not only unit tests."""
