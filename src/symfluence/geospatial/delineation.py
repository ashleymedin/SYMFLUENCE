"""Domain delineation module for watershed boundary extraction and spatial discretization.

Provides flexible domain delineation workflows supporting five distinct modeling paradigms:
point-scale (FLUXNET), lumped watershed (conceptual), distributed geofabric subsetting,
full TauDEM-based watershed delineation, and grid-based discretization. Integrates with
geofabric providers (MERIT-Basins, HydroSHEDS) and DEM-based delineation.

Architecture:
    The delineation module enables multiple domain definition workflows through the
    DomainDelineator orchestrator class:

    1. Five Domain Definition Methods:
       - POINT: Single-polygon square domain for point-scale modeling (FLUXNET, weather stations)
       - SUBSET: Extract domain from existing geofabric via spatial intersection
       - LUMPED: Single-basin watershed from pour point (traditional hydrological modeling)
       - DELINEATE: Full subcatchment delineation via TauDEM (distributed models like SUMMA)
       - DISTRIBUTE: Regular grid cells with D8 flow routing (grid-based models like VIC, MESH)

    2. Delineation Workflows:
       Point → Point-scale forcing, constant attributes, single model HRU
       Subset → Extract from HydroSHEDS/MERIT-Basins, subset attributes
       Lumped → Single-HRU model, simplified routing, traditional calibration
       Delineate → Subcatchment-scale HRUs, complex routing, distributed parameters
       Distribute → Grid cells (~1 km), cell-based routing, fully distributed

    3. Lumped-to-Distributed Routing (Special Workflow):
       - Hydrological model runs as lumped (single basin, 1 HRU)
       - Routing model runs as distributed (subcatchment-level)
       - Requires area-weighted remapping from lumped model outputs
       - Configuration: domain.delineation.routing = "river_network"

    4. Artifact Tracking:
       DelineationArtifacts dataclass tracks:
       - method: Domain definition method used (point, subset, lumped, delineate, distribute)
       - river_basins_path: Subcatchment polygons shapefile
       - river_network_path: River network polyline shapefile
       - pour_point_path: Outlet point coordinate
       - metadata: Method-specific configuration (grid cell size, coastal delineation flags)

    5. Component Integration:
       - GeofabricDelineator: TauDEM-based full delineation
       - GeofabricSubsetter: Spatial intersection with existing shapefiles
       - LumpedWatershedDelineator: Single-watershed creation
       - PointDelineator: Bounding box domain
       - GridDelineator: Regular grid discretization

Configuration Parameters:
    domain.definition_method: Delineation method (point, subset, lumped, delineate, distribute)
    domain.delineation.routing: Routing mode for lumped domain (lumped, river_network)
    domain.delineation.geofabric_type: Source geofabric (merit_basins, hydrosheds)
    domain.delineation.delineate_coastal_watersheds: Enable coastal special handling (bool)
    domain.grid_cell_size: Grid spacing in meters (distribute method, default 1000.0)
    domain.clip_grid_to_watershed: Clip grid cells to watershed boundary (bool)
    paths.river_basins_name: Pre-existing shapefile basename (skip delineation if provided)

Output Files:
    river_basins_path: shapefiles/river_basins/{domain_name}_riverBasins_{method}.shp
    river_network_path: shapefiles/river_network/{domain_name}_riverNetwork_{method}.shp
    pour_point_path: shapefiles/pour_point/{domain_name}_pourPoint.shp

Use Cases by Method:
    1. POINT: FLUXNET tower calibration, single weather station forcing, small-scale studies
    2. SUBSET: Continental-scale studies (extract subset of larger geofabric)
    3. LUMPED: Traditional bucket-model calibration (GR4J, GR6J, conceptual models)
    4. DELINEATE: Physically-distributed LSM calibration (SUMMA, HYPE with TauDEM)
    5. DISTRIBUTE: Grid-based land surface models (VIC, MESH, CLM at 1 km resolution)

Example Workflows:
    Point-scale: FLUXNET site → Point domain (10×10 km) → Model forcing
    Lumped: Pour point → Single-basin domain → Simple routing (usually no routing)
    Lumped-to-Distributed: Lumped model HRU → Distributed subcatchments → MizuRoute routing
    Distributed: Pour point → TauDEM delineation → Subcatchments → SUMMA + MizuRoute
    Grid: Domain extent → Regular grid → D8 routing → VIC/MESH

    Central delineation orchestrator enabling flexible domain definition strategies. Routes
    to appropriate delineator based on configuration (point, subset, lumped, delineate, distribute)
    and tracks all outputs via DelineationArtifacts. Integrates five specialized delineators
    through composition, supporting everything from point-scale FLUXNET sites to fully
    distributed watershed models.

    The DomainDelineator implements the Facade Pattern, providing a unified interface
    (define_domain()) that routes to component delineators while managing artifact tracking,
    configuration lookup, logging, and error handling.

    Key Responsibilities:
        1. Domain Method Routing: Select appropriate delineator based on configuration
        2. Artifact Tracking: Collect and return all shapefile paths via DelineationArtifacts
        3. Configuration Management: Lazy configuration lookup with safe defaults
        4. Lumped-to-Distributed Support: Optionally delineate subcatchments within lumped domain
        5. Path Resolution: Resolve output paths using PathResolverMixin

    Five Delineation Methods:

        POINT: Single-polygon bounding box domain for point-scale modeling
            - Use case: FLUXNET sites, weather stations, single-point forcing
            - Delineator: PointDelineator
            - Output: Single polygon (typically 10×10 km bounding box)
            - No river network (attributes uniform across domain)
            - Configuration: domain.definition_method = 'point'

        SUBSET: Extract domain from existing geofabric via spatial intersection
            - Use case: Continental studies, work within larger geofabric (MERIT-Basins, HydroSHEDS)
            - Delineator: GeofabricSubsetter
            - Output: Subcatchment polygons + river network from geofabric source
            - Supports geofabric_type selection (merit_basins, hydrosheds, etc.)
            - Configuration: domain.definition_method = 'subset'

        LUMPED: Single-basin watershed from pour point (traditional lumped modeling)
            - Use case: GR4J/GR6J calibration, lumped conceptual models, simple routing
            - Delineator: LumpedWatershedDelineator
            - Output: Single polygon representing entire watershed
            - Optional: Delineate internal subcatchments for distributed routing (lumped-to-distributed)
            - Configuration: domain.definition_method = 'lumped'
            - Special feature: domain.delineation.routing = 'river_network' enables distributed routing

        DELINEATE: Full watershed delineation using TauDEM and DEM
            - Use case: SUMMA, HYPE with distributed physics, detailed subcatchment process modeling
            - Delineator: GeofabricDelineator
            - Output: Multiple subcatchment polygons + full river network
            - Optional: Coastal delineation for basins draining to ocean
            - Configuration: domain.definition_method = 'delineate'

        DISTRIBUTE: Regular grid cells with D8 flow routing
            - Use case: Grid-based LSMs (VIC, MESH, CLM) at 1 km resolution
            - Delineator: GridDelineator
            - Output: Grid cells as polygons with D8 connectivity
            - Configurable grid spacing (default 1000 m) and watershed clipping
            - Configuration: domain.definition_method = 'distribute'

    Lumped-to-Distributed Routing Workflow (Special Case):
        Enables hybrid workflow where:
        - Hydrological model runs as lumped (single HRU, fast)
        - Routing model runs as distributed (subcatchments, accurate)
        - Requires area-weighted remapping from lumped outputs to subcatchments

        Triggered by: domain.delineation.routing = 'river_network'
        When triggered in lumped method:
            1. Primary domain: Single-basin lumped domain
            2. Delineation: Internal subcatchment delineation via GeofabricDelineator
            3. Output: Metadata includes 'delineated_river_basins_path' and 'delineated_river_network_path'
            4. Routing: MizuRoute uses delineated network and area-weighted lumped outputs

    Component Integration:
        - GeofabricDelineator: TauDEM + DEM-based delineation
        - GeofabricSubsetter: Spatial subsetting of existing shapefiles
        - LumpedWatershedDelineator: Single-basin creation (usually via subsetting)
        - PointDelineator: Bounding box geometry creation
        - GridDelineator: Regular grid discretization with D8 routing

    Artifact Management:
        define_domain() returns tuple of (result_object, DelineationArtifacts):
        - result_object: Varies by method (Path or tuple of paths)
        - DelineationArtifacts: Standardized container with river_basins_path, river_network_path,
          pour_point_path, and method-specific metadata

    Configuration Parameters:
        domain.definition_method: Delineation method (required, defaults to 'lumped')
        domain.delineation.routing: Routing mode for lumped domain (default 'lumped')

    Error Handling:
        - Graceful fallback if shapefile pre-exists (skip delineation)

            - Remapping: MizuRoute uses area-weighted remapping from lumped HRU to subcatchments

        Rationale for Lumped-to-Distributed Routing:
            - Computational efficiency: Model runs as lumped (much faster than distributed)
            - Physical accuracy: Routing uses distributed network (subcatchment-level flows)
            - Parameter simplicity: Single parameter set for lumped model
            - Routing accuracy: MizuRoute uses proper flow routing on distributed network
            - Example: GR4J model (lumped) with MizuRoute (distributed) on subcatchments

        Delineation Workflow:
            1. Calls GeofabricDelineator.delineate_geofabric() to delineate subcatchments
            2. Generates TauDEM-based river network and subcatchment polygons
            3. Returns delineated network and basin paths
            4. Primary paths (lumped domain) remain unchanged in artifacts
            5. Delineated paths stored in artifacts.metadata for routing use

        Output Files:
            - delineated_river_network_path: River network polyline shapefile
              * Format: shapefiles/river_network/{domain_name}_riverNetwork_delineated.shp
              * Geometry: Polyline features representing delineated stream segments
              * Used by: MizuRoute for distributed routing

            - delineated_river_basins_path: Subcatchment polygon shapefile
              * Format: shapefiles/river_basins/{domain_name}_riverBasins_delineated.shp
              * Geometry: Polygon features representing delineated subcatchments
              * Attributes: Subcatchment IDs, area, etc.
              * Used by: MizuRoute for area-weighted remapping

        Error Handling:
            - Logs detailed error with traceback if delineation fails
            - Logs warning if delineation returns None or incomplete outputs
            - Returns (None, None) on failure (checked by caller)
            - Raises RuntimeError in caller if delineation fails (critical for routing)

        Returns:
            Tuple of (delineated_river_network_path, delineated_river_basins_path):
                - delineated_river_network_path (Path): River network polyline shapefile
                  Returns None if delineation fails

                - delineated_river_basins_path (Path): Subcatchment polygon shapefile
                  Returns None if delineation fails

        Example:
            >>> # Lumped-to-distributed routing scenario
            >>> config.domain.definition_method = 'lumped'
            >>> config.domain.delineation.routing = 'river_network'
            >>> result, artifacts = delineator.define_domain()
            >>> # define_domain() internally calls _delineate_lumped_domain()
            >>> # artifacts.river_basins_path: Lumped domain (1 polygon for GR4J)
            >>> # artifacts.metadata['delineated_river_basins_path']: Subcatchments
            >>> # Downstream:
            >>> #   1. Run GR4J model → 1 HRU output (streamflow, evap, etc.)
            >>> #   2. MizuRoute remaps 1 HRU → subcatchments (area-weighted)
            >>> #   3. MizuRoute routes on delineated_river_network

        Implementation Notes:
            - Called only if lumped domain routing='river_network' (rare special case)
            - Separate from primary lumped domain (which is single polygon)
            - Uses GeofabricDelineator (same as delineate method)
            - Returns output paths for metadata storage (not returned to user directly)
            - Critical for routing workflow (fails if cannot delineate)

        Central orchestration method that routes to the appropriate delineation workflow based on
        domain.definition_method configuration. Manages artifact tracking, error handling, and
        special workflows (lumped-to-distributed routing).

        This method implements the Strategy Pattern: selects a concrete delineation strategy
        (point, subset, lumped, delineate, distribute) at runtime based on configuration.

        Workflow:
            1. Load domain definition method from config (default: 'lumped')
            2. Create DelineationArtifacts to track outputs
            3. Check for pre-existing shapefiles (short-circuit if provided)
            4. Route to appropriate delineation method
            5. Return (result_object, artifacts) tuple

        Method Routing:
            point → PointDelineator.create_point_domain_shapefile()
                Returns: Single polygon Path
                Output paths: river_basins_path only (point-scale)

            subset → GeofabricSubsetter.subset_geofabric()
                Returns: Subset result object
                Output paths: river_basins_path, river_network_path from geofabric

            lumped → LumpedWatershedDelineator.delineate_lumped_watershed()
                Returns: Tuple of (river_network_path, river_basins_path)
                Output paths: river_basins_path, river_network_path
                Special: If routing='river_network', calls _delineate_lumped_domain()
                    to create internal subcatchments for distributed routing

            delineate → GeofabricDelineator.delineate_geofabric()
                Returns: Tuple of (river_network_path, river_basins_path)
                Output paths: river_basins_path, river_network_path
                Optional: If delineate_coastal_watersheds=True, uses coastal delineation

            distribute → GridDelineator.create_grid_domain()
                Returns: Tuple of (river_network_path, river_basins_path)
                Output paths: river_basins_path (grid cells), river_network_path (D8 paths)
                Metadata: Stores grid_cell_size and clip_to_watershed config

                If paths.river_basins_name is explicitly set (not 'default'):
                    → Skip all delineation
                    → Return None with method in artifacts
                    → Allows pre-computed shapefile reuse

            Lumped-to-Distributed Routing:
                Triggered by: domain.delineation.routing = 'river_network'
                Only applies to: lumped method
                Workflow:
                    1. Create primary lumped domain (single basin)
                    2. Internally call _delineate_lumped_domain() for subcatchments
                    3. Store lumped paths in artifacts (primary)
                    4. Store delineated paths in artifacts.metadata (routing)
                    5. MizuRoute uses metadata paths with area-weighted remapping

                Example configuration:
                    domain:
                      definition_method: lumped
                      delineation:
                        routing: river_network  # Enables lumped-to-distributed

                Output:
                    - artifacts.river_basins_path: Lumped domain (for hydrological model)
                    - artifacts.metadata['delineated_river_basins_path']: Subcatchments (for routing)
                    - MizuRoute remaps lumped model output (1 HRU) to subcatchments

            Coastal Delineation:
