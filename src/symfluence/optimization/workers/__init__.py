Optimization Workers

Worker classes that handle the evaluation of parameter sets during optimization.
Each worker is responsible for:
- Applying parameters to model configuration files
- Running model simulations
- Calculating objective metrics from outputs

Available workers:
- BaseWorker: Abstract base class for all workers
- WorkerTask: Data structure for worker inputs
- WorkerResult: Data structure for worker outputs

Model-specific workers are available via:
1. Direct import: from symfluence.optimization.workers.{model}_worker import {Model}Worker
2. Registry pattern: OptimizerRegistry.get_worker('{MODEL}')

Note: Model-specific workers are NOT eagerly imported here to avoid circular dependencies.
As models migrate to symfluence.models/{model}/calibration/, the old paths become facades
that re-export from the new location. Eager imports would create circular dependencies:
  optimization.workers.__init__ → workers.fuse_worker → models.fuse.calibration →
  optimization.optimizers.base_model_optimizer → optimization.workers.base_worker →
  optimization.workers.__init__ (CYCLE!)
