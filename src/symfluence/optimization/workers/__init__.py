Optimization Workers

Worker classes that handle the evaluation of parameter sets during optimization.
Each worker is responsible for:
- Applying parameters to model configuration files
- Running model simulations
- Calculating objective metrics from outputs

Available workers:
- BaseWorker: Abstract base class for all workers
- WorkerTask: Data structure for worker inputs
- WorkerResult: Data structure for worker outputs
- SUMMAWorker: Worker for SUMMA model calibration
- FUSEWorker: Worker for FUSE model calibration
- NgenWorker: Worker for NextGen model calibration
- HYPEWorker: Worker for HYPE model calibration
- GRWorker: Worker for GR model calibration
