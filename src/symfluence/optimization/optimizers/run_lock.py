"""Exclusive lock over a calibration's parallel run directory.

Per-process calibration trees live under ``simulations/run_<algorithm>/
process_<i>`` and are scoped inside by experiment and model
(``simulations/{experiment_id}/{model}``, ``settings/{model}``), so different
models may legitimately calibrate concurrently in one domain. A collision
occurs only when the SAME model and experiment are run twice at once.
Merely constructing a second optimizer re-stages settings over a live run's
files, and calling its ``cleanup()`` deletes them outright — observed
destroying a live NSGA-II calibration mid-run, after which every evaluation
failed and the workflow still reported success (see issue #329).

This module makes that collision loud and immediate instead of silent and
destructive: the first process to reach the directory writes a lock naming
itself, and a second live process refuses to start.

The lock is deliberately advisory-but-checked rather than an OS file lock:
runs are long, machines crash, and a hard lock left behind by a killed job
would be worse than the collision it prevents. Liveness is therefore checked
against the recorded PID *and* its start time, so a stale lock from a dead or
recycled PID is reclaimed automatically.
