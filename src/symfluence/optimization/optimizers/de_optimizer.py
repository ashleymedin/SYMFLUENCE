    """Differential Evolution (DE) Optimizer for SYMFLUENCE.

    DE is a population-based stochastic optimization algorithm that uses vector
    differences between population members to guide the search. Unlike PSO which
    uses velocity-based movement, DE creates trial solutions by mutating existing
    population members with scaled differences of other members. This self-adaptive
    approach makes DE particularly effective for continuous optimization.

    Algorithm Overview:
        DE solves: maximize score
        1. Initialize population: N random solutions in [0,1]
        2. For each generation:
           a. For each population member i:
              - Select three distinct random members r1, r2, r3 (r1 ≠ i)
              - Create mutant: v = x_r1 + F * (x_r2 - x_r3)
                where F is scaling factor controlling differential variation
              - Apply clip to [0,1]
              - Binomial crossover: for each parameter:
                * With probability CR: inherit from mutant
                * Otherwise: keep from original
              - Ensure at least one parameter from mutant (j_rand)
           b. Evaluate all trial solutions
           c. Greedy selection: if trial better than current, accept
           d. Track best solution found so far

    Key Features:
        - Population-based (explores multiple solutions in parallel)
        - Derivative-free (works without gradient information)
        - Self-adaptive: population diversity guides mutation strength
        - Effective on both unimodal and multimodal landscapes
        - Robust to noise (multiple trial comparisons reduce noise sensitivity)
        - Mutation via differences: F*(x2-x3) creates adaptive step sizes
        - Fewer parameters than GA: only F and CR need tuning

    Why DE Works:
        - Vector differences encode local geometry: (x2-x3) points toward promising regions
        - Scaling factor F adapts search neighborhood automatically
        - Crossover creates diversity while exploiting good components
        - Greedy selection ensures progress (hill climbing component)
        - Population maintains multiple search directions simultaneously
        - Often outperforms PSO on noisy objectives or high-dimensional problems

    Strategy Notation: DE/rand/1/bin
        - DE: Differential Evolution base
        - rand: Base vector selected randomly (not best, reduces bias)
        - 1: Single difference vector (x_r2 - x_r3)
        - bin: Binomial (per-parameter) crossover

    Configuration Parameters:
        DE_SCALING_FACTOR (F): Differential weight (default: 0.5)
                  Controls mutation step size: v = r1 + F*(r2-r3)
                  Typical range: 0.4-1.0
                  F < 0.5: Conservative, local refinement
                  F = 0.5-0.8: Balanced exploration/exploitation
                  F > 0.8: Aggressive global exploration
                  Too high F: Instability, premature divergence
                  Too low F: Slow convergence, stagnation
        DE_CROSSOVER_RATE (CR): Probability parameter inheritance (default: 0.9)
                  Probability each parameter comes from mutant vs original
                  Typical range: 0.5-0.95
                  CR < 0.5: More original components, slow adaptation
                  CR = 0.7-0.9: Typical, good convergence
                  CR > 0.95: Rapid change, may lose promising solutions
        POPULATION_SIZE: Number of trial solutions (default: auto 4*n_params, 15-50 bounds)
                  Larger populations: more robust, slower per generation
                  Smaller populations: faster per generation, less reliable
        NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS: Total generations (= max evaluations / population_size)

    Comparison with Other Algorithms:
        vs PSO: DE uses difference vectors (geometry), PSO uses velocity (momentum)
                DE more robust on noisy objectives, PSO converges faster on smooth
                DE better for high-dimensional problems
        vs DDS: DE population-based, DDS single-solution
                DE global search, DDS for local refinement
                DE scales better with dimensionality
        vs NSGA2: DE for single-objective, NSGA2 for multi-objective
                  DE simpler, fewer parameters

    Attributes:
        population_size: Number of candidate solutions in population
        F: Differential scaling factor (mutation step control)
        CR: Crossover probability (parameter inheritance from mutant)
        population: Current population (N, n_params) of normalized solutions
        population_scores: Fitness values for each population member

           - All population members participate in mutation (no elite protection)

        DE/rand/1/bin Strategy:

            1. Mutation - create mutant via vector difference
               - Select three distinct random members r1, r2, r3 (all ≠ i)
               - Mutant: v = x_r1 + F * (x_r2 - x_r3)
               - Clip to [0,1] to maintain bounds
            2. Binomial Crossover - create trial from target and mutant
               - For each parameter j: with probability CR inherit from mutant
               - Otherwise keep from original target
               - Ensure at least one parameter from mutant (j_rand, mandatory crossover)

        Why Vector Differences?
            - (x_r2 - x_r3) encodes local geometry: direction from one population
              member toward another
            - Scaling F adapts step size to population diversity (self-adaptive)
            - Adding to random member r1 creates diverse trial points
            - Result: naturally explores regions populated by good solutions

        Crossover Purpose:
            - CR ≈ 1.0: Aggressive change, mostly from mutant (high exploration)
            - CR ≈ 0.5: Balanced mixing, half from each (moderate change)
            - CR ≈ 0.0: Conservative, mostly original (slow adaptation)
            - j_rand ensures at least one component differs from target

        Mathematical Formulation:
            For member i with parameters (x_i1, x_i2, ..., x_in):
            1. v_j = x_r1,j + F * (x_r2,j - x_r3,j)  ∀ j
            2. For each j: if rand(0,1) < CR or j == j_rand:
