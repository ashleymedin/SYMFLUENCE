SCE-UA (Shuffled Complex Evolution - University of Arizona) Algorithm

A global optimization algorithm that combines the strengths of the simplex
procedure with competitive evolution. Widely used in hydrological modeling.

Parallel Execution Design
---------------------------
The original serial SCE-UA processes each complex sequentially, issuing one
``evaluate_solution`` call at a time.  This implementation replaces that serial
pattern with batched evaluation via ``evaluate_population``, which dispatches
all candidates in a batch to the underlying parallel executor (ProcessPool or
MPI) in a single call.

**Why the parallelisation is algorithmically valid**

The CCE procedure evolves each complex independently.  After the population is
partitioned into complexes, no information flows *between* complexes until the
shuffle step that reunites them at the end of the iteration.  This inter-complex
independence is an explicit, load-bearing property of the SCE algorithm: it is
what gives the S (Shuffled) in the name its meaning.  Exploiting it for
parallelism therefore does not alter the algorithm's search behaviour -- it only
changes the order in which the model is called.

**What is preserved**

The *intra*-complex dependency chain is fully respected.  Within a single
complex, step k+1 uses the complex state that was updated by step k -- this
serial chain cannot be parallelised without changing the algorithm, so it is
not.

**Batching strategy per evolution step**

At each CCE evolution step every complex independently selects a random
simplex, generates a reflection point, and may fall back to a contraction or a
random replacement.  Since the candidates across complexes are independent, we
batch-evaluate them in up to three rounds per step:

  Round 1  -- Reflection batch (always n_complexes candidates)
             Complexes whose reflection improves the worst simplex point accept
             it immediately.  The rest proceed to round 2.

  Round 2  -- Contraction batch (only complexes that failed reflection)
             A contraction point is formed by pulling the worst point halfway
             towards the centroid.  Complexes that improve accept it.  The rest
             proceed to round 3.

  Round 3  -- Random replacement batch (only complexes that failed both)
             A uniformly random point replaces the worst point unconditionally
             (matching the original MATLAB cceua fallback behaviour).

**Worst-case model calls per shuffle iteration**

  Serial original : n_complexes x n_evolution_steps x 3  (all fallback paths)
  Parallel new    : n_evolution_steps x 3 batches          (same calls, fewer wall-clock rounds)

With default settings (5 complexes, 33 evolution steps) this reduces the
number of sequential evaluation rounds from up to 495 to at most 99, giving an
ideal 5x wall-clock speedup when using 5 or more parallel workers.

**Evolution tracking CSVs**

Detailed candidate tracking:
    sce_<run_id>_evolution_tracking.csv

Every evaluated candidate is written to this per-run CSV in the optimization
results directory.  Each row records:

    timestamp, run_id, metric_name, shuffle_iteration, evolution_id,
    complex_id, stage, accepted, score, <param_1>, ..., <param_N>

Key columns:

  stage     -- which CCE sub-step produced this candidate:
               'reflection' | 'contraction' | 'random'

  accepted  -- True  : candidate beat the worst simplex member and was written
                       into the complex.
               False : candidate did NOT improve; the complex is UNCHANGED for
                       this step (the next stage is tried instead).

The 'accepted' flag is essential for interpreting the CSV.  Because all
evaluated candidates are logged (not just accepted ones), a reflection row with
accepted=False simply means that attempt failed and contraction was tried next
-- the complex did not regress.

Per-evolution best-score tracking:
    sce_<run_id>_evolution_best_tracking.csv

This companion CSV writes one row per evolution step with:

        timestamp, run_id, metric_name, shuffle_iteration, evolution_id,
        evolution_best_score, best_score_so_far

This file is designed for quick monotonic-progress inspection without filtering
by stage or accepted flag.

        Acceptance threshold

        Reflection and contraction use the comparison:

        random point replaces the worst simplex member unconditionally.

        Logging order
        -------------
        log_evolution_batch is called AFTER the accept/reject loop for each
        stage.  This ensures the 'accepted' flag in the CSV accurately reflects
        whether the candidate was written into the complex.  If logging were done
        before acceptance, rejected reflection candidates would appear in the CSV
        with low scores under stage='reflection', making it misleadingly look as
        though the complex regressed.

        The algorithm proceeds in three phases:

        1. Initialisation -- A random population of pop_size points is drawn
           and evaluated in one parallel batch.  Points are ranked by fitness
           (descending), establishing the initial complex partition.

        2. Shuffle iterations -- Each iteration:

           a. Partition the ranked population into n_complexes complexes
              using the standard interleaved assignment
              (complex c owns ranks c, c+n_complexes, c+2*n_complexes, ...).

           b. Run n_evolution_steps CCE steps.  At each step:
              - Generate one reflection candidate per complex (CPU-only).
              - Batch-evaluate all reflections in parallel.
              - Accept successful reflections; batch-evaluate contractions for
                failures; accept successful contractions; batch-evaluate random
                replacements for remaining failures.
              All three rounds involve only the complexes that reached that
              stage, minimising total model calls.

           c. Merge the evolved complexes back and re-sort by fitness (shuffle).

        3. Early stopping -- If the best fitness changes by less than
           percent_change_threshold for evolution_stagnation consecutive
           shuffle iterations, optimisation terminates.
