## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **The SYMFLUENCE agent interface** (`symfluence agent`): hands off to an
  installed coding-agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, ...) primed as the
  SYMFLUENCE agent through four provider-agnostic layers, each wired through
  whatever mechanism the CLI declares in the launcher registry: (1) the
  packaged skills; (2) an identity block with live project context (detected
  configs, domain directories) and operating house rules, delivered via the
  CLI's system-prompt flag or the `AGENTS.md` preamble; (3) a dependency-free
  MCP server (`symfluence agent mcp`); (4) packaged specialist subagents
  (`calibration-debugger`, `platform-scout`).
- **Agent modes** (`symfluence agent model` / `symfluence agent code`): two
  first-class session modes, each a frozen `ModeProfile` (`agent/modes.py`)
  that shapes priming end to end. *Modelling* primes the operational skills
  (`explore-platform`, `run-workflow-locally`, `debug-calibration`), both
  subagents, modelling house rules (never edit platform source; drive
  everything through the workflow/MCP tools; report in hydrological terms),
  and a headless tool allowlist for the native chat. *Coding* keeps the full
  skill set and the host CLI's own permissions. Bare `symfluence agent` opens
  the TUI agent screen; `agent doctor` diagnoses the setup per mode (with
  `--json`); `agent mcp --mode` serves one mode's tool profile; skills
  materialize per-mode and copy whole skill directories.
- **MCP background jobs and platform-inspection tools**: the agent MCP server
  exposes 15 tools. `start_workflow_job` / `get_job_status` / `cancel_job` /
  `list_jobs` run workflow executions as detached background jobs (a stdlib
  wrapper records the exit code durably; records and logs live in the agent
  cache; cancellation signals the process group), so a chat session can start
  an hours-long calibration without blocking the MCP connection.
  `read_run_log`, `list_domains`, `calibration_status`, `get_results_summary`,
  `get_plot_paths`, and `compare_experiments` answer the modelling questions
  (log tails, domain inventory, calibration progress, headline KGE/NSE
  metrics, figures, cross-experiment ranking) by reading the `domain_*` tree
  directly with stdlib CSV parsing. `update_config` is the one writer: a
  line-preserving edit of the user's experiment YAML that must pass typed
  `SymfluenceConfig` validation and backs the original up first.
- **Agent home screen with a suspend round-trip**: a minimal Agent home in the
  TUI (mode `7`) — two mode cards (Model / Code) over two dim context lines
  (detected config with a cycle key, runtime readiness); diagnostics behind a
  `d` details modal. Starting a coding session round-trips: the TUI suspends,
  the primed coding-agent CLI runs full-screen in the same terminal, and the
  home screen returns when it exits. Terminals that cannot suspend fall back
  to the classic `AgentHandoff` exec after the TUI exits (`--direct`, a
  one-shot prompt, no TTY, or a missing TUI extra hand off immediately).
- **Native modelling chat**: `symfluence agent model` in the TUI opens a
  SYMFLUENCE-native chat screen driving headless Claude Code over its
  stream-JSON protocol — one bounded subprocess per turn, resumed via Claude
  Code's own session store (`agent/headless.py`: tolerant NDJSON parser →
  typed events; session ids persisted per project+mode). Assistant prose
  streams into the conversation; tool invocations render as compact
  expandable cards (never raw JSON); a run sidebar polls the domain tree and
  background-job records independently of the agent, so an hours-long
  calibration keeps ticking on screen. `esc` interrupts a turn, `ctrl+e`
  exports the conversation as Markdown, and each turn's footer shows
  duration, cost, and the running session total. Codex/Gemini (or a failed
  stream) fall back to the suspend round-trip with modelling priming.
  Stdlib-only driver; no new dependencies.
- **Interactive permission approvals** in the modelling chat: tools outside
  the modelling allowlist route through a hidden `approve_action`
  permission-prompt bridge (`agent/approvals.py`) — the MCP server blocks,
  the chat pops an allow/deny modal, and no reply is a denial. Outside the
  chat the same tools stay hard-denied. ADR-0004 rewritten for the current
  architecture (human-in-the-loop at the layer that executes actions).
- **MESH multi-GRU preprocessing fixes and elevation-band precip correction**:
  GRU-dependent hydrology parameters (ZSNL/ZPLS/ZPLG/...) expand to one value
  per GRU so multi-GRU domains initialize; new forcing keys
  `MESH_PRECIP_LAPSE_RATE` (orographic gradient for elevation-banded forcing)
  and `MESH_PRECIP_MULTIPLIER` (uniform gauge-undercatch correction), both
  defaulting to no-op; `SKIP_WARM_START` documented as defaulting to true so
  calibrations are reproducible regardless of machine history.

### Changed
- **Logging-protocol overhaul** (ADR-0005 enforcement, from an audit of the
  paper-run log corpus where WARNING+ERROR lines outnumbered INFO 1.85:1):
  - One shared protocol module (`core/logging_utils.py`): canonical file
    format (~46% smaller lines: `TIME LEVEL [logger] message`, filename
    `symfluence_{domain}_{experiment_id}_{ts}.log`), `log_once` de-duplicated
    emission, a single third-party suppression table, and one
    `get_worker_logger` bootstrap replacing four bespoke worker setups.
  - Milestone-level INFO everywhere: per-item/per-chunk loops now emit one
    summary line with per-item detail at DEBUG (an ERA5 96-chunk resume drops
    from ~190 INFO lines to 3); hot-loop conditions that produced tens of
    thousands of repeated WARNING/ERROR lines emit once and demote to DEBUG;
    external-model stdout goes to sidecar files referenced by one log line.
  - Comparable calibration progress: every optimizer emits the fixed schema
    `{ALG} {i}/{max} {unit} ({pct}%) | Best | Improved | Crashes | Elapsed`
    with explicit units (evals/gens/epochs/loops) and `[P##]` worker tags;
    GLUE and NSGA-II now stream progress.
  - Honest run reporting: `✗ Failed` completions on failed steps,
    failure-aware workflow end block, `run_summary.json` schema v2 with
    error/warning totals counted from actual log records, per-step
    status+duration aligned with the run manifest.
  - Global `--quiet/-q` flag (console WARNING+; file log unaffected);
    `--debug` unchanged and dominant.
  - `setup_logging` is idempotent per (domain, experiment id) — re-use no
    longer re-opens a new log file per facade construction.
- **Agent verb consolidation**: `agent launch` is deprecated (alias for
  `agent code`, to be removed after one release); the already-deprecated
  `agent start`/`agent run` and the `agent list`/`agent skills` verbs are
  removed (`agent doctor` covers the last two).

### Fixed
- **GR4J no longer dies with a Windows access violation the moment it runs the
  model**: the GR runner built its R script by interpolating `str(Path)` into R
  string literals, so on Windows R's lexer received
  `read.csv("C:\Users\...\domain_x\input.csv")` — in which `\U` opens a Unicode
  escape and `\d` is not an escape at all. Standalone `Rscript` reports that as
  a parse error; the *embedded* interpreter raises it from inside
  `R_ParseVector` and takes the process down with `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION`
  (0xC0000005, reported as exit 139) with no Python frame to trace — after the
  workflow had already spent ~36 minutes preprocessing. Paths now go through
  `r_environment.r_path()`, which renders them with forward slashes (accepted by
  R on every platform), and every generated script is evaluated through
  `r_environment.run_r_script()`, which refuses source containing an invalid R
  escape so a regression is an actionable `ModelExecutionError` instead of a
  bare crash. The same interpolation affected the distributed GR4J path and the
  GR postprocessor's `load()` of `GR_results.Rdata`.
- **GR4J no longer segfaults on Windows because the embedded R cannot load its
  own packages**: rpy2 registers `R_HOME/bin/x64` only via
  `os.add_dll_directory()`, which R's internal `dyn.load()` does not consult, so
  `stats.dll` could not resolve `Rlapack.dll` and *every* compiled R package —
  airGR included — failed to load, while standalone `Rscript` worked fine. R
  reported this as the misleading `package 'stats' in options("defaultPackages")
  was not found`. The new `models/gr/r_environment.py` puts R's binary directory
  on `PATH` (locating R from `R_HOME`, `PATH`, the registry, or `Program Files`)
  before rpy2 starts the interpreter. The GR runner also no longer answers a
  failed `library(airGR)` with `install.packages()` against CRAN: on an offline
  machine that wedged the interpreter into a SIGSEGV 53 minutes into a run.
  airGR is now verified up front, and an unusable one raises an actionable error
  quoting the embedded R's own `R.home()`, `.libPaths()` and load error.
- **Models that build to `<name>.exe` on Windows are found again**: model
  definitions declare POSIX-style executable names (`gsflow`, `prms`) because
  the build scripts run under MSYS bash, where `[ -f bin/gsflow ]` and
  `cp x bin/gsflow` transparently resolve to `gsflow.exe`. `Path.exists()` does
  not, so a GSFLOW that had compiled and linked perfectly well was reported as
  `Model executable not found`. `BaseModelRunner.get_model_executable` now tries
  the `.exe` variant on Windows — matching the `exists_any` rule the install
  verifier already used — and the error lists every name it searched. GSFLOW's
  calibration worker, which resolves the path by hand, got the same treatment,
  and its runner now passes `exe_name_key='GSFLOW_EXE'` so dict-style configs
  can override the name.
- **Windows model processes no longer deadlock at exit**: the Windows release
  job now rebuilds netCDF-C without the AWS S3 SDK
  (`scripts/build_netcdf_no_s3_mingw.sh`) instead of shipping MSYS2's stock
  package. netCDF's `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` hook called `Aws::ShutdownAPI`, which
  waits on AWS CRT worker threads that `RtlExitUserProcess` has already
  terminated — so every SUMMA/FUSE/HYPE run left an unkillable process that
  never signalled, kept its output NetCDF handles locked, and broke subsequent
  calibration evaluations. Byte-range, DAP and NCZarr support are unchanged, and
  the build asserts the result is a drop-in (export-table diff plus a check that
  every symbol `libnetcdff-7.dll` imports is still exported). Linux and macOS
  are untouched: the deadlock needs ExitProcess semantics, and Debian's netCDF
  is already built without the AWS SDK.
- **Every packaged Windows tool now ships the DLLs it imports**: the release
  bundler enumerated images with an `*.exe` glob while staging deliberately
  drops the `.exe` suffix from tool names, so every Fortran model was skipped
  and `libnetcdff-7.dll` was never bundled. Images are now detected by content,
  and `scripts/check_windows_dll_closure.sh` walks each packaged binary's import
  table and fails the release if anything is unresolvable — a missing DLL aborts
  a Windows process with `0xC0000135` before `main()` with no output at all,
  which calibration recorded as a `-9999` score rather than a failure (observed:
  seven native HYPE calibrations silently lost).
- **Stale plugins no longer vanish silently**: a plugin whose `register()`
  fails on SYMFLUENCE API drift (e.g. importing a removed alias) now logs a
  WARNING naming the incompatible package instead of disappearing from the
  registry at DEBUG level; a worker-contract test sweep (AST-resolved method
  calls on every in-repo worker class) guards against the API-drift class of
  calibration-voiding AttributeErrors observed in the paper-run logs.
- **Review follow-ups to the agent interface and CLI option handling** (#300,
  #299): `--dry-run binary <tool>` now previews instead of executing; global
  option normalization no longer steals host-CLI flags from agent-session
  pass-through (structure-aware boundary at REMAINDER subcommands, option
  names derived from a single spec); the MCP server survives non-object
  JSON-RPC input and bounds subprocess output via a temp file; the agent
  screen forwards `--` pass-through args and validates the preselected
  runtime; priming failures degrade with visible warnings and the launch card
  only claims layers that actually activated (a SYMFLUENCE-generated
  `AGENTS.md` is refreshed, a user-authored one is reported as blocking
  injection); frontmatter parsing consolidated into
  `resources.parse_frontmatter`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-07

Archival release accompanying the SYMFLUENCE paper series
("Out-standing in Every Field", "The Registry as Social Contract",
"From Configuration to Prediction"; Eythorsson et al., 2026, Water
Resources Research, submitted). First release archived on Zenodo via the
GitHub integration.

### Added
- **Citation metadata**: `CITATION.cff` (GitHub "Cite this repository") and
  `.zenodo.json` (Zenodo deposit metadata) with the full author list and
  ORCIDs (#269).
- Guard test validating every shipped paper calibration config against the
  strict config schema.

### Changed
- **Paper supplementary configs trimmed to the final manuscript** (#268):
  removed the four cut experiments (decision ensemble, sensitivity analysis,
  large-sample and large-domain Iceland calibration), reduced the forcing
  ensemble to the four reported products (ERA5, RDRS, AORC, CONUS404), and
  kept only the 130 fixed-seed (42) calibration combinations the paper
  reports; all READMEs updated to the manuscript's section and figure
  numbering.

### Fixed
- Shipped calibration configs for the five JAX-native models (HBV, HEC-HMS,
  SAC-SMA, TOPMODEL, Xinanjiang) failed strict validation due to stale keys
  from older plugin schemas (`initial_params`; HBV also `smoothing`,
  `smoothing_factor`) and could not be loaded; the stale keys are removed
  (85 configs).
- Paper-config seed guard repointed after the #268 trim removed the config
  it loaded (#270).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-14

> **Note**: Versions 0.8.0–0.9.0 were tagged and published without CHANGELOG
> entries. This section documents the changes since the v0.9.0 release; the
> 0.8.x/0.9.0 history is not reconstructed here.

### Added
- **Canonical forcing contract (CFIF)**: a single canonical forcing reader keyed
  to CF standard names (CFIF) that model preprocessors consume through one path,
  with automatic resampling of the source to each model's cadence. Adopted by
  SWAT, Wflow, IGNACIO, LISFLOOD, CWatM, PCR-GLOBWB, RHESSys, CLM-ParFlow, and mHM.
- **Model-ready data store for attributes and observations**: new attributes
  reader plus observation/streamflow loaders that source from the model-ready
  store. SUMMA soil/land class and HYPE GeoData (soil/land/elevation) now read
  from the store; `StreamflowMetrics` and the remaining calibration loaders are
  routed through it.
- **Windows binary builds** for many models — WATFLOOD (bundled Waterloo CHARM
  prebuilt), ParFlow, CLM-ParFlow, PRMS, VIC, PIHM, mHM, WRF-Hydro, and glacier —
  via MinGW/MSYS2 POSIX shims and CMake/NetCDF wiring.
- **WATFLOOD**: full Unix and Windows source builds; CHARM runs on the datastore;
  parallel-calibration plumbing.
- **GSFLOW**: datastore-driven inputs and a distributed-groundwater option.
- **mHM**: CARRA forcing support and distributed-morphology (MPR) mode.
- WATFLOOD and GSFLOW standalone postprocessors registered.

### Changed
- **Agent interface simplified to a launcher.** `symfluence agent launch` now hands
  off to an installed coding-agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, ...), primed with
  the SYMFLUENCE skills, instead of running a bespoke in-house LLM agent. It detects
  the CLI on `PATH` and uses whichever API key is set (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY`); override with `SYMFLUENCE_AGENT_CLI`, skip
  skill materialization with `SYMFLUENCE_NO_SKILLS`. The skills now ship inside the
  package. *(net ~ −7,000 LOC)*
- **Config schema canonicalization (toward 1.0)**: promoted data-handler,
  HYPE/NGEN/FUSE/GR/mizuRoute/path, multi-gauge, optimizer/evaluator, and
  parameter-bounds flat keys to typed Pydantic fields; `RECOGNIZED_FLAT_KEYS` is
  now closed; the `state` and `data_assimilation` sections are wired into the
  flat-key transform; IGNACIO/GNN/LSTM schemas reconciled with the registered
  ones. Strict config-key validation is enforced and dogfooded on shipped configs.
- Documentation: root `ARCHITECTURE.md` at-a-glance, an ADR practice with the
  initial ADR set, and a threat model (`docs/security.md`).
- Evaluation: unified catchment-area resolution between trial and final-eval
  metrics (resolves the FUSE final-eval KGE divergence).
- Performance: RTI review item 20 hot-spots — rasterio hoist, Julian-date
  vectorization, coastal-partition rewrite — plus a CLI performance gate.
- Core layering restored: no `core` → upper-layer imports (RTI item 19).

### Fixed
- **Data acquisition**: MERIT-Basins region table and dead-host download; Daymet
  gridded OPeNDAP route (descending y, DAP2); HRRR LCC-grid windowing; CERRA
  longwave variable name; NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 synthetic-airpres survival and hardening;
  DEM merge pixel-grid snap; MSWEP remote path and default version; SMHI
  skip-if-raw-exists guard; EM-Earth S3 handler (403 visibility, credentials,
  month window); WSC GeoMet paging corruption and NLDAS-2 v2.0 variable names;
  USGS NWIS gauge-local → UTC timestamps; GRACE atomic `.part` downloads.
- **HYPE**: clone over `https://` with retry, replacing the deprecated
  `git://` SourceForge transport that intermittently broke nightly and release
  builds.
- **CLM** build: NetCDF library symlinks for PIO (Debian multiarch), git
  `safe.directory` re-assert after HOME change, `mpi-serial` pin, and Perl
  `XML::LibXML` install.
- Hardcoded `*3600` hourly-conversion bugs in the Wflow and IGNACIO forcing paths.
- **Windows builds**: WATFLOOD DLL staging, PIHM `timegm` guard, ParFlow
  `mkdir`/path compatibility, PRMS NetCDF path quoting and `gnu17`, VIC version
  macros, mHM NetCDF detection, and WRF-Hydro checkout.
- **Glacier**: earthaccess auth for NSIDC, RGI region-name transform, and
  coldstart fixes.
- **PRMS**: resilience-handler tracebacks (`exc_info=True`) and HRU parameters
  driven from the datastore.
- SWAT preprocessor registered via `core.registries.R` to avoid a circular import.

### Removed
- **Deprecated `register*` decorator registry API** — registration is now
  R-facade only. *(breaking)*
- **Deprecated `*Postprocessor` spelling aliases** — use `*PostProcessor`.
  *(breaking; external plugins must update)*
- **HYDROGEOSPHERE** model stub. *(breaking)*
- The **CalMIP** example stub.
- **DPE** (differentiable PE) and other dead/external config keys; shipped
  configs curated accordingly.
- **The bespoke in-house LLM agent** (`symfluence.agent` internals) and the
  optional `[llm]`/`openai` dependency — replaced by the launcher above.
  `symfluence agent start`/`run` are deprecated aliases for `launch`. *(breaking:
  the agent now requires an external coding-agent CLI)*

### CI / Release
- `release-binaries`: build MODFLOW 6 from source on Linux, build ngen on
  Linux/macOS, skip CLM on Windows (ESMF/CIME on MinGW unsupported), close
  presence-check holes and surface failed optional builds, and don't clobber the
  latest release on a tagless `workflow_dispatch`.
- Strict config-key validation dogfooded on shipped configs (kept out of the
  lint job, which has no `symfluence` install).
- Require the `PostProcessor`-spelling plugin releases.

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **HPC file-locking workaround**: Added tempfile fallback (attempt 4) to ERA5
  NetCDF writer for parallel filesystems (Lustre/GPFS/BeeGFS) where HDF5
  `fcntl()` locking fails even with `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE`. Writes to
  `$TMPDIR` first, then moves the file to the target path.
- **mizuRoute Makefile build**: Collapse multi-line `LIBNETCDF` before appending
  RPATH flags to avoid breaking backslash continuation (caused "missing separator"
  errors on CI).
- **ngen linker (expat)**: Detect system UDUNITS2 via `pkg-config`/`ldconfig`
  (not just explicit env var) so `-lexpat` is added for XML symbol resolution.
- **Wflow calibration**: Fix snow parameters, routing, and unit conversion issues.
  Add Oudin PET, log-transform bounds, and sub-daily resampling support.
- **FUSE preprocessing**: Make streamflow observations optional.
- **MPI launcher**: Add fallback when preferred launcher fails; prefer `mpirun`
  over `srun` for launcher detection.

### Added
- SPDX license headers on all source files.
- Coverage tracking in cross-platform CI workflow.
- Unit tests for NGEN, JFUSE, HYPE model runners and configs.
- Unit tests for core modules (file_utils, validation, path_resolver).
- Unit tests for `_safe_to_netcdf` fallback chain.
- WATFLOOD: Expand calibration to 16 parameters with tests.
- Bow River preset and default `DEM_SOURCE` to Copernicus.
- Config-hash stage invalidation for workflow orchestrator.

- **HBV Sub-Daily Parameter Scaling**
  - Implemented exact exponential scaling for recession coefficients (K0, K1, K2)
  - Formula: `k_sub = 1 - (1 - k_daily)^(dt/24)` replaces linear approximation
  - Eliminates ~5-13% error in recession behavior at sub-daily timesteps
  - Flux rate parameters (CFMAX, PERC) continue to use linear scaling
  - Added `FLUX_RATE_PARAMS` and `RECESSION_PARAMS` constants

- **MESH Preprocessing Consolidation**

  - Expanded `parameter_fixer.py` with robust parameter handling
  - Updated NALCMS to CLASS land cover mapping (wetland, snow/ice corrections)
  - Added unit conversion utilities for forcing data
  - Improved logging (replaced debug prints with proper logger calls)

- **FLUXCOM ET Acquisition Rework**
  - Replaced stub ICOS downloader with fully functional `_download_from_icos()` using ICOS Carbon Portal metadata API
  - Smart variable matching (exact name, then substring, then fallback)
  - Automatic unit conversion (W/m2, mm/hr, mm/day)
  - Nearest-neighbor fallback for basins smaller than the grid cell

- **MODIS ET Acquisition Improvements**
  - Spatial subsetting via sinusoidal projection for large tiles with small domains
  - Improved special-value masking (all MODIS QC codes, not just fill value)
  - SDS name matching now tries exact match before substring search

- **Reporting Module Cleanup**
  - Simplified plotter implementations
  - Improved shapefile handling

- **Example Notebooks — Typed Config Migration**
  - Migrated notebooks 02a–03b from legacy `yaml.safe_load` + flat dict pattern to `SymfluenceConfig.from_minimal()` typed config API
  - All 9 example notebooks (01a–04b) now use the same typed, validated, frozen config pattern
  - Removed MAF-specific language from all example notebooks; acquisition comments now reference `DATA_ACCESS: 'cloud'` or `'maf'` config setting
  - Fixed pre-existing bugs: 02a `NameError` on config access, 03b `cf.managers` wrong variable name, 03b config overwrite bug, 03b outdated CLI syntax

### Fixed
- MESH lumped mode routing: switched from `run_def` to `noroute` mode to correctly preserve lower-zone baseflow (`wf_lzs`); `run_def` in MESH 1.5.6 bypasses `STGGW` storage, causing zero baseflow
- Traceback handling in MESH postprocessor
- Added missing `pydantic` runtime dependency to `pyproject.toml`
- Fixed invalid escape sequences in `__init__.py` warning filters for Python 3.12+ compatibility
- CI pipeline now correctly fails on unit/integration test regressions (removed `|| true` from pytest invocations)

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive sub-daily simulation section to HBV model guide
- Documented parameter scaling approaches (exact vs linear)
- Added validation methodology for sub-daily implementations

**Benefits of new CLI:**
- Clearer command organization and discoverability
- Better help messages (`symfluence workflow --help` shows workflow-specific options)
- Easier to extend with new commands
- Industry-standard pattern (like git, docker, kubectl)

## [0.5.2] - 2025-11-12

### Major: Formal Initial Release with End-to-End CI Validation

**This release marks the first fully reproducible SYMFLUENCE workflow with continuous integration.**

### Added
- **End-to-End CI Pipeline (Example Notebook 2a Equivalent)**
  Integrated a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that builds, validates, and runs SYMFLUENCE automatically on every commit to `main`.
  - Compiles all hydrologic model dependencies (TauDEM, mizuRoute, FUSE, NGEN).
  - Validates MPI, NetCDF, GDAL, and HDF5 environments.
  - Executes key steps (`setup_project`, `create_pour_point`, `define_domain`, `discretize_domain`, `model_agnostic_preprocessing`, `run_model`, `calibrate_model`, `run_benchmarking`).
  - Confirms reproducible outputs under `SYMFLUENCE_DATA_DIR/domain_Bow_at_Banff`.
  - Runs both wrapper (`./symfluence`) and direct Python entrypoints equivalently.

### Changed
- Updated `external_tools_config.py` to include automatic path resolution for TauDEM binaries (e.g., `moveoutletstostrms → moveoutletstostreams`).
- Expanded logging and run summaries for CI visibility.
- Protected `main` branch to require successful CI validation before merge.

### Notes
This release formalizes SYMFLUENCE's **reproducibility framework**, guaranteeing that all supported workflows can be rebuilt and validated automatically on clean systems.
