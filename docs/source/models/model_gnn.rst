Overview
========

The GNN (Graph Neural Network) model in SYMFLUENCE is a cutting-edge data-driven approach that leverages graph-based deep learning to predict streamflow across river networks. Unlike traditional LSTMs that treat each basin independently, GNNs explicitly model the spatial connectivity and upstream-downstream relationships within river networks.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Spatial graph-based streamflow prediction
- Explicit river network topology modeling
- Multi-site simultaneous prediction
- Information propagation along river network
- Transfer learning across basins in same network
- Scalable to large river networks
- Regional-scale prediction

**Typical Applications:**

- River network-wide streamflow prediction
- Multi-site calibration and prediction
- Ungauged basin prediction (network-informed)
- Regional hydrological modeling
- Data assimilation in river networks
- Ensemble forecasting across networks
- Climate change impact on river systems

**Spatial Scales:** River network (100s to 1000s of connected basins)

**Temporal Resolution:** Daily to hourly

GNN Architecture for Hydrology
==============================

Graph Neural Networks Fundamentals
----------------------------------

**What is a Graph?**

In hydrology, a graph represents a river network:

.. code-block:: text

   Nodes:  Basins/catchments
   Edges:  River connections (upstream → downstream)

   Example River Network:

   Basin A ──→ Basin B ──→ Basin D (outlet)
               ↗
   Basin C ───┘

**Graph Structure:**

- **Nodes (V):** Each basin with attributes (area, elevation, land cover, etc.)
- **Edges (E):** Directed connections representing flow direction
- **Adjacency Matrix (A):** Defines connectivity

GNN Message Passing
-------------------

GNNs learn by passing information along graph edges:

**Process:**

1. **Node features:** Each basin has forcing data + static attributes
2. **Message passing:** Information flows from upstream to downstream
3. **Aggregation:** Each node receives messages from upstream neighbors
4. **Update:** Node updates its hidden state based on messages
5. **Prediction:** Final layer predicts streamflow

**Hydrological Intuition:**

- Upstream precipitation affects downstream flow (captured via message passing)
- Basin characteristics influence how water is routed (learned node embeddings)
- River network topology constrains predictions (graph structure)

Model-Specific Workflows
========================

Basic GNN Workflow
-----------------

River network with multiple gauged basins:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # config.yaml
   DOMAIN_NAME: river_network
   HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: GNN

   # Define network domain
   DOMAIN_DEFINITION_METHOD: river_network
   RIVER_NETWORK_FILE: ./network_topology.json

   # Or use basin delineation (auto-creates network)
   DOMAIN_DEFINITION_METHOD: merit_basins
   MERIT_BASIN_IDS: [10234, 10235, 10236, 10237, 10238]  # Connected basins

   # Forcing
   FORCING_DATASET: ERA5
   FORCING_START_YEAR: 2010
   FORCING_END_YEAR: 2020

   # GNN configuration
   GNN_HIDDEN_SIZE: 128
   GNN_NUM_LAYERS: 3
   GNN_EPOCHS: 300

   # Data split
   CALIBRATION_PERIOD: [2010, 2017]  # Training + validation
   VALIDATION_PERIOD: [2018, 2020]   # Testing

Run:

.. code-block:: bash

   symfluence workflow run --config config.yaml

   # Training uses all gauged basins simultaneously
   # Predicts for ungauged basins within network

Large River Network Application
-------------------------------

For major river systems (e.g., Mississippi, Amazon):

.. code-block:: yaml

   # config.yaml
   DOMAIN_DEFINITION_METHOD: merit_basins
   MERIT_BASIN_IDS: [...]  # 500+ connected basins

   HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: GNN

   # Larger network for big system
   GNN_HIDDEN_SIZE: 256
   GNN_NUM_LAYERS: 4

   # More epochs for complex network
   GNN_EPOCHS: 500

   # GPU essential
   USE_GPU: true

   # Batch training
   GNN_BATCH_SIZE: 128

Ungauged Basin Prediction
-------------------------

Predict streamflow at ungauged locations:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # config.yaml
   # Define network including ungauged basins
   MERIT_BASIN_IDS: [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]  # 5 basins

   # Observations available for basins 101, 103, 105
   # Basins 102, 104 are ungauged

   HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: GNN

   # GNN will use network structure to inform predictions
   # at ungauged basins 102 and 104

Transfer Learning Across Networks
---------------------------------

Train on one network, apply to another:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Step 1: Train on data-rich network
   # config_source_network.yaml
   DOMAIN_NAME: colorado_river
   MERIT_BASIN_IDS: [...]  # Well-gauged network

   HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: GNN
   GNN_EPOCHS: 300

   # Save model
   GNN_SAVE_MODEL: true

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Step 2: Apply to data-sparse network
   # config_target_network.yaml
   DOMAIN_NAME: snake_river
   MERIT_BASIN_IDS: [...]  # Sparse gauge network

   HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: GNN

   # Load pre-trained model
   GNN_LOAD: true
   GNN_PRETRAINED_MODEL: ../colorado_river/models/GNN/best_model.pt

   # Fine-tune with available data
   GNN_EPOCHS: 50

Hyperparameter Tuning
=====================

Key Hyperparameters
------------------

**1. Hidden Size**

.. code-block:: yaml

   GNN_HIDDEN_SIZE: [64, 128, 256, 512]

- Larger = more capacity, more parameters
- 128-256 typical for medium networks (50-100 basins)
- 512+ for very large networks (500+ basins)

**2. Number of Layers**

.. code-block:: yaml

   GNN_NUM_LAYERS: [2, 3, 4, 5]

- More layers = information propagates farther in network
- 2-3 layers: local information (immediate neighbors)
- 4-5 layers: basin receives info from basins several hops away
- Diminishing returns after 4-5 layers

**3. Dropout**

.. code-block:: yaml

   GNN_DROPOUT: [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5]

- Higher = more regularization
- 0.2-0.3 typical
- Increase if overfitting

**4. Learning Rate**

.. code-block:: yaml

   GNN_LEARNING_RATE: [0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005]

- 0.001 is good starting point
- Lower if training unstable
- Higher for faster convergence

Automated Tuning
---------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Use optimization framework
   OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM: RandomSearch

   # Define search space
   GNN_HIDDEN_SIZE: [128, 256]
   GNN_NUM_LAYERS: [3, 4]
   GNN_DROPOUT: [0.2, 0.3]

   # Optimize network-averaged metric
   OPTIMIZATION_METRIC: KGE_network_avg
   OPTIMIZATION_MAX_ITERATIONS: 15

Known Limitations
================

1. **Network Data Required:**

   - Needs river network topology
   - All basins in network need forcing data
   - Can't apply to isolated single basins easily

2. **Computational Cost:**

   - Training entire network is expensive
   - GPU strongly recommended
   - Scales poorly to 1000+ basin networks without optimization

3. **Data Hungry:**

   - Needs many gauged basins for training (ideally 20+)
   - Fewer gauges = degraded performance
   - Small networks (<10 basins) may not benefit over LSTM

4. **Black Box:**

   - Even less interpretable than LSTM
   - Hard to diagnose why predictions fail
   - Graph structure helps slightly but still opaque

5. **Extrapolation Issues:**

   - Same issues as LSTM for climate change
   - Cannot extrapolate outside training distribution
   - Ungauged basins still challenging if very different from gauged

6. **Network Topology Sensitivity:**

   - Incorrect network structure = poor performance
   - Errors in basin connectivity propagate
   - Need accurate DEM and flow routing

Troubleshooting
==============

Common Issues
-------------

**Error: "PyTorch Geometric not found"**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install PyTorch Geometric (GNN library)
   pip install torch-geometric

   # Or with conda:
   conda install pyg -c pyg

**Error: "River network file missing"**

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Provide network topology
   RIVER_NETWORK_FILE: ./network_topology.json

   # Or use MERIT basins (auto-creates network)
   DOMAIN_DEFINITION_METHOD: merit_basins
   MERIT_BASIN_IDS: [...]

**Error: "Graph connectivity error"**

Check network topology:

.. code-block:: python

   import json
   with open('network_topology.json') as f:
       net = json.load(f)

   # Verify all edges reference valid nodes
   node_ids = {n['id'] for n in net['nodes']}
   for edge in net['edges']:
       assert edge['source'] in node_ids
       assert edge['target'] in node_ids

**Poor performance on ungauged basins**

1. **Increase number of gauged basins in training**
2. **Add more static attributes** (land cover, soil, topography)
3. **Use more GNN layers** (information propagates farther)
4. **Ensure network topology is correct**

**Overfitting (train >> val performance)**

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Increase regularization
   GNN_DROPOUT: 0.4
   GNN_L2_REGULARIZATION: 1e-5

   # Reduce capacity
   GNN_HIDDEN_SIZE: 64
   GNN_NUM_LAYERS: 2

**Slow training**

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Use GPU (essential for GNN)
   USE_GPU: true

   # Larger batches
   GNN_BATCH_SIZE: 128

   # Fewer layers
   GNN_NUM_LAYERS: 2

**NaN predictions**

1. Check for missing forcing data across network
2. Verify normalization didn't produce NaNs
3. Reduce learning rate
4. Check network topology for cycles or disconnected components

Performance Tips
===============

Improving Accuracy
------------------

1. **More gauged basins:** 20+ gauges >> 5 gauges
2. **Rich static attributes:** Land cover, soil, geology, climate indices
3. **Accurate network topology:** Verify with DEM-derived flow directions
4. **Deeper networks:** 4-5 layers for large networks
5. **Multi-task learning:** Predict flow + other variables (e.g., snow)

Speeding Up Training
-------------------

1. **Use GPU** (10-100x faster)
2. **Smaller networks** (reduce hidden size, layers)
3. **Graph sampling** (train on subgraphs for very large networks)
4. **Early stopping** (patience = 20-30)
5. **Larger batches** (if memory allows)

Deployment
---------

After training, GNN is fast for inference:

.. code-block:: python

   # Predict entire network in milliseconds
   # Ideal for operational forecasting

Comparing with Other Models
===========================

**GNN vs LSTM:**

- Use GNN if: Many connected basins, network structure important
- Use LSTM if: Single basin or independent basins

**GNN vs Physics-Based:**

- GNN advantages: Fast, learns complex patterns, no calibration
- Physics advantages: Interpretable, extrapolates better, works with less data

**Recommendation:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Multi-model ensemble
   HYDROLOGICAL_MODEL: [SUMMA, LSTM, GNN]

   # GNN excels at spatial patterns
   # LSTM at temporal patterns
   # SUMMA at physical processes
