# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records significant architecture and policy decisions for
SYMFLUENCE as short, dated documents. An ADR captures the *context* a decision
was made in, the *decision* itself, and its *consequences*, so that a choice
which is easy to make once and easy to forget later remains legible to future
contributors.

ADRs are immutable once accepted. A decision is changed not by editing its ADR
but by adding a new ADR that supersedes it; the old record stays in place with
its status updated to `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`. This keeps the history of *why*
intact rather than overwriting it.

## When to write one

Write an ADR when a decision (a) affects a stable interface or public contract
(see [GOVERNANCE.md](../../GOVERNANCE.md) §4), (b) sets a project-wide policy a
contributor could otherwise reasonably guess wrong, or (c) resolves a question
that has surfaced more than once. Routine bug fixes and local implementation
choices do not need one.

## Format

Each ADR follows a light [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-style template:
a status line, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**, and **References**.
Keep them short — an ADR is a record, not a design document.

ADR-0000 records the baseline decisions the codebase was built on, written
down retroactively when the ADR practice was adopted; ADR-0001 onward record
decisions made (or made explicit) ahead of the 1.0 release.
